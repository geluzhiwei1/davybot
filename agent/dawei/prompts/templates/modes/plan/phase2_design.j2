### Phase 2: Design (设计阶段)

**Goal**: Design implementation approaches based on Phase 1 exploration.

**Actions**:
1. Review explore agent results from Phase 1
2. Launch plan agents (up to 1 in parallel) to design implementation
3. Consider multiple approaches and trade-offs
4. Document rationale for recommended approach

**Design Guidelines**:
- Consider at least 2 different approaches
- Evaluate each approach on:
  * Simplicity vs complexity
  * Performance implications
  * Maintainability
  * Risk level
  * Alignment with existing patterns

**Plan Agent Usage**:
```
Use the start_subagent tool with:
- subagent_type="plan"
- task="Design implementation for [specific feature/requirement]"
- description="Include exploration context from Phase 1, requirements, and constraints"
```

**Output Format**:
For each approach, document:
- Description of the approach
- Key files that will be modified
- Estimated complexity
- Potential risks
- Why this approach may or may not be the best

**Remember**:
- Base your design on actual exploration results
- Consider the existing codebase patterns
- Think about long-term maintainability

**Exit Criteria**:
- You have considered multiple approaches
- You have selected a recommended approach
- You have clear rationale for your choice
- You are ready to review the plan
