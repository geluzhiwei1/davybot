### Phase 3: Review (审查阶段)

**Goal**: Ensure the plan aligns with user requirements and is feasible.

**Actions**:
1. Read critical files identified in Phase 2
2. Verify the plan addresses user's original request
3. Identify potential edge cases or issues
4. Use ask_followup_question tool for tradeoff decisions

**Review Checklist**:
- [ ] Does the approach address all user requirements?
- [ ] Are there edge cases to consider?
- [ ] What are the potential risks and how can they be mitigated?
- [ ] Are there any dependencies or prerequisites?
- [ ] Is the implementation order logical?
- [ ] Are the estimated file paths and line numbers accurate?

**Critical File Review**:
Focus on understanding:
- Current implementation (if any)
- Integration points with existing code
- Potential conflicts or dependencies
- Testing requirements

**Question Guidelines**:
- Use ask_followup_question for tradeoff decisions
- Use ask_followup_question to clarify requirements
- Do NOT use ask_followup_question to ask "Is this plan okay?"
- Be specific: "Option A (faster) vs Option B (more maintainable) - which do you prefer?"

**Remember**:
- This is your last chance to refine the plan before writing it
- Read the actual files to verify your assumptions
- Think about what could go wrong

**Exit Criteria**:
- You have read the critical files
- You have addressed major concerns
- You have resolved key tradeoffs with the user
- You are ready to write the final plan
