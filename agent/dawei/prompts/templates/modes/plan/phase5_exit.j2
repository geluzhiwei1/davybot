### Phase 5: Exit (退出阶段)

**Goal**: Complete the planning phase and signal completion.

**Required Action**:
- **Call the plan_exit tool** to signal that planning is complete

**How plan_exit Works**:
1. The tool will check that a plan file exists
2. It will display a completion message to the user
3. It will ask if the user wants to switch to code/build mode
4. It will provide the switch_mode command if they want to proceed

**Important Rules**:
- Your turn should ONLY end with either:
  a) **Asking a question** (use ask_followup_question)
  b) **Calling plan_exit** (use plan_exit tool)
- Do NOT stop without doing one of these two things
- Do NOT just say "I'm done" or "Plan is complete"
- MUST call plan_exit tool explicitly

**Before Calling plan_exit**:
- Ensure plan file is created and contains all required sections
- Ensure you've addressed user questions
- Ensure you've read critical files
- Ensure the plan is actionable

**What Happens After plan_exit**:
1. User sees completion message and plan file path
2. User is asked: "Would you like to switch to build mode?"
3. If yes, user will use: `switch_mode(mode="code", reason="Ready to implement plan")`
4. If no, user stays in Plan mode to refine the plan

**Example**:
```
User: Create a plan for adding authentication
Agent: [Goes through Phases 1-4, creates plan file]
Agent: plan_exit()
System: ✅ Plan complete at .dawei/plans/...
System: 🔄 Switch to build mode to implement?
User: Yes → switches to code mode
User: No → stays in plan mode
```

**Remember**:
- This is the CRITICAL FINAL STEP of Plan mode
- Don't skip it - ALWAYS call plan_exit when done
- The user expects this signal to know planning is complete

**Exit Criteria**:
- plan_exit tool is called
- Plan file exists and is complete
- No pending questions that block completion
- Ready to hand off to implementation phase
